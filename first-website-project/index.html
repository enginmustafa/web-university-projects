        <ol type='1'>
          <li>During WW2, Royal Air Force fighter pilots started a rumor that excessive carrot consumption gave gunners night vision. The point of the rumor was to distract the Germans from RAF’s new radar technology. Because of this rumor, Germans began eating large quantities of carrots.</li>
          <li>Chuck Yeager, was the first man to fly faster than the speed of sound.</li>
          <li>During WW2, a single American P-51 fighter plane held off 30 German fighters from attacking a squadron of B-17 bombers for over a half an hour.</li>
          <li>In 1953 due to high speed a F-11 fighter shot itself because it was faster than it’s own bullet.</li>
          <li>In 1983, an Israeli pilot successfully landed and F-15 with only one wing. The pilot didn’t realize the extent of the damage until after landing. He stated he would have ejected if he had known.</li>
          <li>A McDonnell Douglas F-15 once shot down a satellite.</li>
          <li>The only plane allowed to fly on 9/11 after the attacks was a plane from San Diego to Miami delivering anti-venom to a man bitten by a highly poisonous snake. The plane was accompanied by two jet fighters.</li>
          <li>The Lockheed U-2 is so hard to land that on every landing,the plane is paced by a chase car such as the Camaro SS with an assistant “talking” the pilot down. Since 2001, more than a dozen pilots have suffered the effects of decompression sickness and nine were reported to have suffered permanent brain damage.</li>
          <li>4 Phantom II was called “World’s Leading Distributor of MiG Parts” because it destroyed so many MiG fighters</li>
          <li>During WW2, while parachuting from a damaged bomber, an American aviator downed, a Japanese fighter plane by shooting the pilot in the head with his sidearm.</li>

        <h2>Fighter aircraft</h2>
        <p> The primary role of fighters is destroying enemy aircraft in air-to-air combat, as part of both offensive and defensive counter air operations. Many fighters also possess a degree of ground attack capability, allowing them to perform surface attack and close air support missions. In addition to their counter air duties they are tasked to perform escort mission for bombers or other aircraft. Fighters are capable of carrying a variety of weapons, including machine guns, cannons, rockets, guided missiles, and bombs. Many modern fighters can attack enemy fighters from a great distance, before the enemy even sees or detects them. Examples of fighters include the F-22 Raptor, F-15 Eagle, and Su-27.</p>
        <h2>Bomber aircraft</h2>
        <p> Bombers are normally larger, heavier, and less maneuverable than fighter aircraft. They are capable of carrying large payloads of bombs, torpedoes or cruise missiles. Bombers are used almost exclusively for ground attacks and not fast or agile enough to take on enemy fighters head-to-head. A few have a single engine and require one pilot to operate and others have two or more engines and require crews of two or more. A limited number of bombers, such as the B-2 Spirit, have stealth capabilities that keep them from being detected by enemy radar. An example of a conventional modern bomber would be the B-52 Stratofortress. An example of a World War II bomber would be a B-17 Flying Fortress. Bombers include light bombers, medium bombers, heavy bombers, dive bombers, and torpedo bombers.</p>
        <h2>Attack aircraft</h2>
        <p> Attack aircraft can be used to provide support for friendly ground troops. Some are able to carry conventional or nuclear weapons far behind enemy lines to strike priority ground targets. Attack helicopters attack enemy armor and provide close air support for ground troops. An example historical ground-attack aircraft is the Soviet Ilyushin Il-2 Shturmovik. Several types of transport airplanes have been armed with sideways firing weapons as gunships for ground attack. These include the AC-47 and AC-130 aircraft.

        In modern air forces the distinction between bombers, fighter-bombers, and attack aircraft has become blurred. Many attack aircraft, even ones that look like fighters, are optimized to drop bombs, with very little ability to engage in aerial combat. Indeed, the design qualities that make an effective low-level attack aircraft make for a distinctly inferior air superiority fighter, and vice versa. Perhaps the most meaningful distinction is that a bomber is generally a long-range aircraft capable of striking targets deep within enemy territory, whereas fighter bombers and attack aircraft are limited to 'theater' missions in and around the immediate area of battlefield combat. Even that distinction is muddied by the availability of aerial refueling, which greatly increases the potential radius of combat operations.</p>
        <h2>Electronic warfare aircraft</h2>
        <p> An electronic warfare aircraft is a military aircraft equipped for electronic warfare (EW) - i.e. degrading the effectiveness of enemy radar and radio systems. They are generally modified versions of other pre-existing aircraft. A recent example would be the Boeing EA-18G Growler, which is a modified version of the Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet.</p>
        <h2>Maritime patrol aircraft</h2>
        <p>A maritime patrol aircraft fixed-wing military aircraft designed to operate for long durations over water in maritime patrol roles—in particular anti-submarine, anti-ship and search and rescue. Some patrol aircraft were designed for this purpose, like the Kawasaki P-1. Many others are modified designs of pre-existing aircraft, such as the Boeing P-8 Poseidon, which is based on the Boeing 737-800 airliner.</p>
